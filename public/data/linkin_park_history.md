# Linkin Park History

Linkin Park is an American rock band that formed in Agoura Hills, California, in 1996. The band's founding members were Mike Shinoda, Brad Delson, and Rob Bourdon. After a few lineup changes, the band was joined by vocalist Chester Bennington in 1999. The band's current lineup consists of vocalists Emily Armstrong and Mike Shinoda, guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave "Phoenix" Farrell, and drummer Rob Bourdon. The band also has a new drummer, Colin Brittain, who joined in 2023.

The band rose to international fame with their debut album, *Hybrid Theory* (2000), which was certified Diamond by the RIAA. The album's success was followed by the remix album *Reanimation* (2002), and their second studio album, *Meteora* (2003). *Meteora* topped the Billboard 200 chart and was another major success for the band.

Linkin Park has experimented with their sound throughout their career, incorporating elements of rock, metal, hip-hop, and electronic music. Their later albums, such as *Minutes to Midnight* (2007), *A Thousand Suns* (2010), *Living Things* (2012), *The Hunting Party* (2014), and *One More Light* (2017), saw the band exploring different musical directions.

Tragically, lead vocalist Chester Bennington died in 2017, which led to the band going on hiatus. The band returned in 2023 with a new lineup and released the album *From Zero* in 2024. The band has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. They have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards.
